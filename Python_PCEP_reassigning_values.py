# Below is an example where you are assigning variable age to a value and then creating a new variable
# that adds the variable age to a number and prints the output
age = 34
new_age = age + 5
print(new_age)
# Output:
# 39

# Below is an example where you are assigning variable age to a value and then incrementing it by 7
age = 34
age = age + 7
print(age)
# Output:
# 41

# Below is an example of incrementation again except a different way to express it
age = 34
age += 7
print(age)
# Output:
# 41

# Below is an example of printing different texts together
text = 'Talha' + 'Rahman'
print(text)

# Below is an example of printing same text multiple number of times
